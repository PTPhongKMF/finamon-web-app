# 10 Essential Tips for Personal Financial Planning

Financial planning doesn't have to be complicated. Here are 10 essential tips to get you started on your journey to financial freedom.

## 1. Create a Budget and Stick to It

The foundation of all financial planning is a solid budget. Here's how to create one:

- Track all income sources
- List fixed expenses (rent, utilities, etc.)
- Account for variable expenses
- Set aside money for savings
- Use the 50/30/20 rule:
  - 50% for needs
  - 30% for wants
  - 20% for savings

## 2. Build an Emergency Fund

Your emergency fund should cover 3-6 months of living expenses. Here's why:

- Protection against unexpected job loss
- Coverage for medical emergencies
- Buffer for major repairs
- Peace of mind

> "An emergency fund isn't just savings – it's your financial safety net."

## 3. Start Investing Early

$10,000 invested at age 25 with 7% return = $149,745 at age 65
